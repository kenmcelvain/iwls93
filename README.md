# International Workshop on Logic Synthesis 1993 (IWLS93) Benchmark Set

It is 30 years later and new citations regularly appear today.  Back in 1993 I put together this benchmark set.  It combines previous input circuits with new circuits, including some larger multi-level circuits.

The original writeup can be found in iwls93.pdf.

The benchmark set also includes a set of test patterns (in the **tv** directory) and a simulator (**esim**) to verify that optimized circuits implement the intended function.  This is important because the easiest way to achieve really good area and timing is to change the function.   Many researchers at the time had too much confidence in the correctness of their algorithms.

The simulator is a small event driven simulator.   The real value here is the test patterns which were generated by a sequential ATPG program (not included). The test patterns respect don't cares in the input specification.
